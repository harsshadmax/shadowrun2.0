# Shadow-Run

**A behavioural verification gate for AI coding agents.** Before an agent's `pip install` is allowed, Shadow-Run
runs the package inside a locked-down sandbox full of fake secrets, watches what it actually does, and decides
**ALLOW**, **BLOCK** or **ESCALATE** with a deterministic policy. No LLM is in the decision path.

> **Honest claim.** Shadow-Run reduces the chance and the blast radius of a malicious install. It does not prove
> safety. Every number here comes from a small, self-written, simulated benchmark.
>
> Everything is a **simulation**: the packages, the agent and the secrets are fake, and payloads can only reach a
> sink container inside an internal Docker network. Nothing touches a real host.

## Quick start: from a fresh clone to the dashboard

About 10 minutes the first time (most of it is downloading Docker images). You need **Windows 11 with WSL2 and an
Ubuntu distro**, or any Linux machine with Docker. Every command below runs **inside the Ubuntu (Linux) terminal**, not
in PowerShell, unless a step says otherwise.

**Step 0. Get Ubuntu on WSL2** (skip if you already have it). In PowerShell, run `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`, reboot if
asked, then open "Ubuntu" from the Start menu and create your Linux user. Check with `wsl -l -v` that its VERSION is 2.

**Step 1. Install the tools** (Docker engine, Python venv, strace, git):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io python3-venv python3-pip strace git curl
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**Step 2. Reload your group and start Docker.** Close the Ubuntu window. In **PowerShell** run `wsl --shutdown`, then
open Ubuntu again and run:

```bash
sudo service docker start
docker run --rm hello-world
```

You should see "Hello from Docker!". (On WSL without systemd you need `sudo service docker start` after every restart
of WSL. Docker Desktop with WSL integration enabled for Ubuntu also works and needs no `service` command.)

**Step 3. Clone the repository.** The work is on the `security-fixes-and-redesign` branch (the repo has no `main` yet).
Keep it in your Linux home folder, not under `/mnt/c`:

```bash
git clone -b security-fixes-and-redesign https://github.com/harsshadmax/shadowrun2.0.git ~/shadowrun2.0
cd ~/shadowrun2.0
```

**Step 4. Create the Python environment and install:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

**Step 5. Build the six simulated packages.** This only assembles files; it never runs their code:

```bash
python packages/build_all.py
```

Expected: `built 6 packages into .../packages/dist`.

**Step 6. Start the sandbox services.** This builds two small Docker images the first time (a few minutes), creates the
internal network, and starts the sink and a local package registry:

```bash
bash scripts/up.sh
```

Expected last line: `up: sink + pypiserver started`.

**Step 7. Check that the sandbox is safe to use.** Every line must say PASS or runs are refused:

```bash
python -m shadowrun.cli doctor
```

Expected: eight `[PASS]` lines and `DOCTOR: ALL PASS`.

**Step 8. Start the dashboard:**

```bash
python -m shadowrun.cli serve
```

Leave this terminal open. It prints nothing while it works.

**Step 9. Open the dashboard.** In your Windows browser go to **<http://127.0.0.1:8000>**. The header should show
"Doctor PASS" and the page is empty until you run a scan.

**Step 10. Try it.**

1. Press **Run scan** (top left), choose `M1 · report-export-pro`, press **Run**. Expect **BLOCKED** with
   `CANARY_READ`, `NET_OUTBOUND` and `CANARY_EXFIL` after about 3 seconds.
2. Run `B2 · csvtoolkit`. Expect **ALLOWED**.
3. Open the **Demo** tab in the sidebar and press **Start demo** to see the same install with and without the gate,
   and the simulated agent switching to a safe package.
4. Use **Sandbox health** (right side) to see the doctor result with its check id and time.

**To stop:** press `Ctrl+C` in the server terminal, then `bash scripts/down.sh`.
**To start again later:** open Ubuntu and run

```bash
cd ~/shadowrun2.0 && source .venv/bin/activate
sudo service docker start      # not needed with Docker Desktop
bash scripts/up.sh && python -m shadowrun.cli serve
```

**If something goes wrong**

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `permission denied` talking to Docker | You skipped the `wsl --shutdown` in step 2, so your new group is not active yet. Do it and reopen Ubuntu. |
| `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon` | Run `sudo service docker start` (or start Docker Desktop). |
| `Address already in use` on port 8000 | Another server is running: `fuser -k 8000/tcp`, or start on another port with `python -m shadowrun.cli serve --port 8010`. |
| Doctor shows a `[FAIL]` line | Read its message. Usually `bash scripts/up.sh` was not run, or Docker is not running. Fix it and rerun `doctor`. Scans are refused until it passes. |
| Dashboard header says `Doctor UNKNOWN` or `STALE` | The status is older than 2 minutes or not checked yet. It re-checks itself when no scan is running; or press **Re-check now** in the Sandbox health panel. |
| Windows browser cannot open `127.0.0.1:8000` | The server listens on localhost only and relies on WSL's localhost forwarding. In PowerShell run `wsl --update` then `wsl --shutdown`, reopen Ubuntu and start again. |
| `pip install -e .` fails | Make sure the virtual environment is active (the prompt starts with `(.venv)`). |

Prefer the command line? `python -m shadowrun.cli pip install report-export-pro` runs one scan and exits with code 2
(BLOCK), 3 (needs review) or 0 (ALLOW). More commands are in [section 10](#10-setup-use-and-demo).

## 1. The problem and the idea

AI coding agents install packages on their own. A name check or a vulnerability list will not catch a package whose
`setup.py` quietly reads `~/.ssh/id_rsa` the moment it is installed. Shadow-Run looks at **behaviour** instead of
reputation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Agent asks: pip install X"] --> G{"Shadow-Run gate"}
    G -->|"1. run X in a trap<br>full of fake secrets"| S["Sandbox"]
    S -->|"2. what did it touch?<br>who did it call?"| E["Evidence"]
    E --> P{"Policy"}
    P -->|"clean"| OK["ALLOW"]
    P -->|"reads secrets, phones home,<br>persists, hash mismatch"| NO["BLOCK"]
    P -->|"odd but unclear"| REV["ESCALATE<br>needs human review"]
```

The trap works because the secrets are **canaries**: unique, fake values (`CANARY-<run>-ssh`). If one ever shows up
in the sink's log, we know exactly which file was stolen and sent.

## 3. Anatomy of one scan

What happens between "install this" and the verdict (about 2.5 to 3 seconds once the sandbox is warm).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Ag as Agent or CLI
    participant Gate as Pipeline
    participant Reg as Local registry
    participant Sbx as Analysis sandbox
    participant Sink as Sink
    participant Rules as Detector and policy
    participant Log as Audit log

    Ag->>Gate: install report-export-pro
    Gate->>Log: ACTION_RECEIVED
    Gate->>Gate: doctor must pass (else refuse)
    Gate->>Reg: GET /simple/report-export-pro/
    Reg-->>Gate: file bytes
    Gate->>Gate: SHA-256 pin
    Gate->>Log: FETCHED (name, version, sha256)
    Gate->>Sbx: start with fake home, file mounted read-only
    Note over Sbx: offline pip install,<br>hash required, under strace
    Sbx->>Sbx: setup.py opens ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Sbx->>Sink: POST /collect with the key
    Sbx-->>Gate: strace log
    Sink-->>Gate: requests from the sandbox's IP
    Gate->>Log: SANDBOX_FINISHED
    Gate->>Rules: events plus sink data
    Rules-->>Gate: CANARY_READ, NET_OUTBOUND, CANARY_EXFIL
    Gate->>Log: FINDINGS_RECORDED, DECISION_MADE
    Gate-->>Ag: BLOCKED, with the evidence
```

Phases are timed individually (fetch, hash, sandbox, analyze, decide) and shown live in the dashboard.

---

## 4. Isolation: what the sandbox can and cannot reach

The trap only works if nothing can escape it. `shadowrun doctor` proves each arrow below before every run.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph sbx["Analysis container"]
        subgraph root["Root domain: strace, trace folder (root-only tmpfs)"]
            TR["strace<br>records open, connect, exec, writes"]
            EV[("/trace/trace.log<br>mode 600, root-owned")]
        end
        subgraph pkgd["Unprivileged domain: no capabilities, no-new-privileges"]
            PKG["Package code<br>runs during install"]
            HOME["Fake home<br>canaries + decoys"]
        end
    end
    SINK["Sink<br>logs, never answers with data"]
    NET["Real internet"]
    HOST["Host files, Docker socket"]

    PKG -->|"reads / writes"| HOME
    PKG -->|"allowed: the only route out"| SINK
    PKG -. "blocked: internal network,<br>no route, no DNS" .-x NET
    PKG -. "blocked: nothing mounted,<br>no socket" .-x HOST
    PKG -. "blocked: EACCES on every attempt" .-x EV
    TR -. "observes" .-> PKG
    TR --> EV
```

| Control | Setting | Checked by doctor |
|---|---|---|
| Network | `shadowrun_net` is `internal=True` | Internal flag, `1.1.1.1` unreachable, `example.com` does not resolve |
| Sink reachable | Sandbox can POST to `sink:9000` only | Round trip logged by the sink |
| Observation | `strace -f` with a pinned syscall list | Records a canary `openat` and a `connect` |
| Filesystem | Read-only root, `/tmp` and `/work` as tmpfs, fake home writable | Write to `/etc` fails, `/tmp` is executable |
| Privileges | Tracer: root with only `SYS_PTRACE`, `SETUID`, `SETGID`. Package: host uid via `setpriv`, no capabilities, `no-new-privileges` | `CapEff` is zero for the package |
| Evidence | Trace lives in a root-only tmpfs; the package cannot open, truncate, delete, replace or list it, or signal the tracer | 8 tampering attempts all denied, trace hash verified |
| Limits | 512 MB, 1 CPU, 128 pids, 30 s timeout, container always removed | Timeout test |

If any doctor check fails, **runs are refused** (fail closed).

### How the evidence is protected, collected and trusted

Before the 2.0 hardening the trace was written to a folder the package could also write to, so a hostile
`setup.py` could have erased its own evidence. Now the tracer and the package live in different privilege domains and
the host fetches the trace over a channel the package cannot reach.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Host as Host pipeline
    participant Tr as strace (root)
    participant Pkg as Package (unprivileged)
    participant Det as Detector

    Host->>Tr: start container, wrapper script
    Tr->>Pkg: setpriv drops to host uid, runs pip install
    Pkg->>Pkg: tries to wipe or replace /trace/trace.log
    Note over Pkg: EACCES, and the attempt is itself recorded
    Pkg-->>Tr: exits
    Tr->>Tr: writes exit status, done marker
    Host->>Tr: docker exec: stat, sha256, cat (root)
    Host->>Host: owner 0:0, mode 600, size and hash must match
    Host->>Det: verified trace
    Det->>Det: complete? (exit notice, no unresumed calls, no cut-off strings, pip seen)
    Det-->>Host: findings, or INCOMPLETE_TRACE / EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE / EVIDENCE_TAMPERED
```

Missing or partial evidence is never treated as "nothing happened": it produces an **indeterminate**, denied verdict
(`ESCALATE`, shown as "Indeterminate"). Evidence that fails its integrity checks is a **BLOCK**.

### Registry allowlist and sandbox health

- **Downloads:** the fetcher only talks to the origin(s) in `config.REGISTRY_ALLOWLIST` (default: the local
  pypiserver). Links inside registry pages and redirect targets go through the same exact scheme/host/port check, hosts
  are resolved once and the connection is pinned to that validated IP (no DNS rebinding), and non-public addresses are
  refused unless the allowlist entry itself is a loopback or private literal.
- **Health:** one shared status (`shadowrun/health.py`) feeds the gate, the header pill and the Sandbox health panel.
  Every check has an id and time, each run records which check gated it, and the dashboard shows **PASS, FAIL, STALE
  or UNKNOWN** explicitly. A doctor check never runs concurrently with a scan.

---

## 5. What is detected and how it is decided

### Detector rules

| Rule | Fires when | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `CANARY_EXFIL` | A canary token for this run appears in the sink's data | critical |
| `HASH_MISMATCH` | pip rejects the file against the pinned SHA-256 | critical |
| `CANARY_READ` | Package code opens a canary file (even if the open fails) | high |
| `NET_OUTBOUND` | Any `connect` except loopback and the resolver (the install is offline, so none is legitimate) | high |
| `PERSISTENCE_WRITE` | Write to `.bashrc`, `.profile`, autostart, cron, `authorized_keys` | high |
| `UNEXPECTED_EXEC` | `execve` of a binary outside the allowed list | medium |
| `WRITE_OUTSIDE_ALLOWED` | Write outside `/work`, `/tmp`, `/home/sandbox/.cache` | medium |
| `SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` | Run exceeded the timeout | medium |
| `EVIDENCE_TAMPERED` | Trace ownership, mode, size or hash failed verification | critical |
| `EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE` | The trace could not be collected (container gone, file missing, too large) | medium |
| `INCOMPLETE_TRACE` | Empty, unparseable, truncated or cut-short trace; cut-off strings; pip never seen executing | medium |
| `INSTALL_FAILED` | pip failed for another reason | low |

Reading a **decoy** (`.gitconfig`, `.bash_history`, ...) is never a finding, so a benign `git` call does not trigger
the gate. Detection is calibrated so that pip's own activity yields zero findings on a real wheel and a real sdist.

### From findings to a verdict

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    F["All findings from the run"] --> R1{"CANARY_EXFIL or<br>HASH_MISMATCH?"}
    F --> R2{"CANARY_READ, PERSISTENCE_WRITE<br>or NET_OUTBOUND?"}
    F --> R3{"UNEXPECTED_EXEC, WRITE_OUTSIDE_ALLOWED<br>or SANDBOX_TIMEOUT?"}
    F --> R4{"Worst severity<br>low or none?"}
    R1 -->|"yes"| B["BLOCK"]
    R2 -->|"yes"| B
    R3 -->|"yes"| E["ESCALATE<br>treated as denied"]
    R4 -->|"yes"| A["ALLOW<br>limited evidence"]
    B --> W{"Strictest wins<br>BLOCK > ESCALATE > ALLOW"}
    E --> W
    A --> W
    W --> OUT["Final decision plus every matched rule"]
    ERR["Any error:<br>bad policy, doctor failure,<br>fetch failure, no trace"] -->|"never ALLOW"| DENY["BLOCK or ESCALATE"]
```

All matching rules are recorded, and an ALLOW always carries the words *"no suspicious behaviour in the tested run
(limited evidence)"*.

---

## 6. The simulated attacks

Six fixtures live in `packages/src`. They are assembled **by hand** (`shadowrun/sdist_tool.py`), because
`python -m build` would execute `setup.py` on your machine. Every file starts with
`# SIMULATED TEST FIXTURE. INERT OUTSIDE THE SHADOW-RUN SANDBOX.`

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph benign["Benign: expected ALLOW"]
        B1["B1 tinyjson-utils<br>pure Python wheel"]
        B2["B2 csvtoolkit<br>plain setup.py"]
        B3["B3 gitversion<br>setup.py runs git<br>false-positive test"]
    end
    subgraph evil["Malicious"]
        M1["M1 report-export-pro<br>reads SSH key, POSTs it"]
        M2["M2 reqeusts<br>typosquat: edits .bashrc,<br>steals .env + AWS keys"]
        M3["M3 timekeeper-sync<br>time bomb, fires in 180 days"]
    end
    M1 -->|"BLOCK"| X1["CANARY_READ, NET_OUTBOUND, CANARY_EXFIL"]
    M2 -->|"BLOCK"| X2["+ PERSISTENCE_WRITE"]
    M3 -->|"ALLOW: known miss"| X3["payload never fires in the tested run"]
```

M3 is a **known false negative**: a clock-triggered payload does not run now. The planned fix is a deep mode that
shifts the sandbox clock.

---

## 7. The agent story

The simulated agent's task is *"Add CSV export to the report module."* Without the gate it would install the
stealer. With the gate it is stopped, reads the reason, and picks a safe alternative.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Ag as Simulated agent
    participant Gate as Shadow-Run
    Ag->>Ag: PROPOSE report-export-pro
    Ag->>Gate: submit install, wait for verdict
    Gate-->>Ag: BLOCKED (CANARY_READ, NET_OUTBOUND, CANARY_EXFIL)
    Ag->>Ag: BLOCKED_NOTICE with the reason
    Ag->>Ag: CHOOSE_ALT csvtoolkit
    Ag->>Gate: submit install, wait for verdict
    Gate-->>Ag: ALLOWED (limited evidence)
    Ag->>Ag: CONTINUE, write report_export.py
```

The dashboard's **Split-screen demo** shows both worlds side by side:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph L["Without Shadow-Run"]
        L1["Package installs<br>into the dev environment"] --> L2["Fake SSH key reaches the<br>attacker's sink: LEAKED"]
    end
    subgraph R["With Shadow-Run"]
        R1["Install runs in the sandbox"] --> R2["BLOCKED with evidence"] --> R3["Agent switches to csvtoolkit"] --> R4["Task finished safely"]
    end
```

---

## 8. Audit trail

Every pipeline step appends an entry to an **insert-only** table. Each entry's hash covers the previous entry's hash,
so editing or deleting any row breaks every hash after it.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    G["GENESIS"] --> E1["Entry 1<br>ACTION_RECEIVED<br>hash = H(GENESIS, ts, type, run, payload)"]
    E1 --> E2["Entry 2<br>FETCHED<br>hash = H(hash 1, ...)"]
    E2 --> E3["Entry 3<br>SANDBOX_FINISHED<br>hash = H(hash 2, ...)"]
    E3 --> E4["Entry 4<br>DECISION_MADE<br>hash = H(hash 3, ...)"]
    V["audit verify<br>recomputes the chain"] -. "first mismatch = tampered row" .-> E3
```

Event types: `ACTION_RECEIVED`, `FETCHED`, `SANDBOX_STARTED`, `SANDBOX_FINISHED`, `FINDINGS_RECORDED`,
`DECISION_MADE`, `EVAL_STARTED`, `EVAL_FINISHED`. The dashboard's **Verify chain** button and
`shadowrun audit verify` both run the check. Limit: a chain proves *edits* happened, not that the latest rows were
never truncated.

---

## 9. Benchmark

Three setups run over the six fixtures, three repeats each, after one discarded warm-up (`eval/results/results.md`).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S["6 simulated packages"] --> N["no_guard<br>install in exposed container"]
    S --> C["name_check<br>blocklist + edit distance to popular names"]
    S --> SR["shadowrun<br>full pipeline"]
    N --> M["Counts from the database:<br>attacks stopped, benign wrongly stopped,<br>canary tokens leaked, decision latency"]
    C --> M
    SR --> M
```

| Setup | Attacks stopped | Benign wrongly stopped | Canary tokens leaked | Median decision | Max decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| no_guard | 0 of 3 | 0 of 3 | 3 | n/a | n/a |
| name_check | 1 of 3 (the typosquat) | 0 of 3 | 1 | n/a | n/a |
| shadowrun | 2 of 3 (the time bomb slips through) | 0 of 3 | 0 | 3.1 s | 3.1 s |

> Small demo benchmark: 6 self-written, simulated packages, 3 runs each. It shows the mechanism works on simulated
> attacks, not real-world detection rates. Latency is dominated by container start and install time and was measured
> on this machine.

Reading the table honestly: Shadow-Run's `0` leaked tokens is true **by construction**, because it never installs
outside its sandbox. The attack it missed is M3. The name check only caught the one attack with a lookalike name.

Detection results are identical before and after the 2.0 hardening, but the median decision time rose from 2.6 s
(original code, max 3.5 s) to 3.1 s (max 3.1 s). I did not profile where the extra ~0.5 s goes; the evidence is now
collected over `docker exec` round trips, which is the likely cause. These runs were measured with a warm doctor status
(`gate` ≈ 0 s). A first run after the status expires (120 s) pays for a full doctor check, about 5 s.

Raw output of the validation run (environment, doctor, pytest, benchmark, exit codes) is in
[`evidence/validation.log`](evidence/validation.log).

## 10. Setup, use and demo

### Setup (Windows 11 + WSL2)

The step-by-step version is the [Quick start](#quick-start-from-a-fresh-clone-to-the-dashboard) at the top. The repo
must live in the WSL filesystem (`~/shadowrun2.0`), not under `/mnt/c`.

```bash
# inside Ubuntu on WSL2
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker.io python3-venv python3-pip strace git
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER      # then: wsl --shutdown (from PowerShell) and reopen Ubuntu
sudo service docker start          # WSL without systemd needs this after each WSL restart

git clone -b security-fixes-and-redesign https://github.com/harsshadmax/shadowrun2.0.git ~/shadowrun2.0 && cd ~/shadowrun2.0
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
bash scripts/vendor_assets.sh      # only if dashboard/static/vendor is missing (needs internet once)
python packages/build_all.py       # builds the six simulated packages into packages/dist
bash scripts/up.sh                 # images, internal network, sink, pypiserver
python -m shadowrun.cli doctor     # every check must PASS or runs are refused
```

Docker Desktop with WSL integration also works.

### Use

```bash
python -m shadowrun.cli pip install report-export-pro   # exit 2 = BLOCK, 3 = ESCALATE, 0 = ALLOW
python -m shadowrun.cli serve                           # dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8000
python -m agent.scripted_agent                          # simulated agent against a running server
python -m shadowrun.cli eval --repeats 3                # benchmark -> eval/results/
python -m shadowrun.cli audit verify                    # recompute the audit hash chain

### The dashboard

| Panel | Shows | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Stat cards | Total scans, blocked, allowed | `runs` table |
| Detection matrix | Which rules fired for which package (Findings tab) or decisions per package | `findings`, `runs` |
| Run detail | Timeline per phase, evidence, decision time for the selected run | `runs.phase_ms_json` |
| Isolation | Layout plus the doctor's four sandbox checks | `doctor` |
| Scripted agent | Last transcript lines and a play button | `agent_events` |
| Recent activity | Filter tabs, paging, click a row for its detail | `runs` |
| Demo page | Split-screen demo, benchmark table and chart, audit "Verify chain" | `eval/results/latest.json`, `audit` |

### 5-minute demo script

1. Open `/demo`. The header shows doctor green and **SIMULATED SCENARIOS ONLY**.
2. Press **Start demo**. The simulated agent proposes `report-export-pro`.
3. Left, no guard: the fake SSH key's canary token reaches the sink, shown in red.
4. Right, Shadow-Run: `CANARY_READ`, `NET_OUTBOUND`, `CANARY_EXFIL`, verdict **BLOCKED** with measured seconds. The agent reads the reason, switches to `csvtoolkit`, and finishes.
5. On the overview, **Run scan** a benign package (B1 to B3): it passes unchanged.
6. Run **M3 `timekeeper-sync`**: it is allowed. Say this is the known miss and that a clock-shifting deep mode is the next step.
7. Show the benchmark table with counts, latency and the disclaimer.
8. Press **Verify chain** in the audit panel.
9. Close with: "Shadow-Run reduces the chance and the blast radius. It does not prove safety."

Backup if Docker misbehaves on stage: `eval/results/results.md` and `eval/results/recorded_run.md`.

## 11. Known gaps

**Not built (roadmap):** MODIFY decisions, quick/deep modes and the verdict cache, other evasive packages, replay,
approval UI, LLM explainer, Claude Code hook, shell commands, re-scan, a contained "real install" step, npm, MCP
server, gVisor or Firecracker.

**Read results with these in mind:**

- **M3 (time bomb) is allowed.** A clock-triggered payload does not fire in the tested run. Known false negative.
- **ALLOW is not a safety proof.** Only behaviour during one offline install in one sandbox is observed.
- **Nothing is installed outside the sandbox**, so "leaked tokens: 0" for Shadow-Run is by construction.
- The strace syscall list adds `chdir`, `clone`, `clone3`, `fork`, `vfork` to the blueprint's list so relative paths
  resolve per process. `AF_UNIX` connects are parsed but not flagged. Symlinks are not resolved.
- `sandbox` time is container start plus install, measured together. A first scan after an idle period also
  includes the doctor self-test, so it shows a longer decision time.
- Fixtures are assembled by hand because building them would run `setup.py` on the host.
- The dashboard is dark-only.

Acceptance status for all 17 blueprint items is in [`ACCEPTANCE.md`](ACCEPTANCE.md).

## 12. Repository map and safety rules

```
shadowrun/        sandbox, canary, monitor, detector, policy, fetcher, pipeline, db, audit, doctor, api, ui, stats, cli
sink/  docker/    sink service and the sandbox image
packages/         simulated fixtures (src) and build_all.py
policies/         default.yaml (rules, allowed paths, pip baseline)
agent/            scripted_agent.py (SIMULATED)
eval/             baselines, run_eval, record_run, results/
dashboard/        Jinja templates, CSS, JS, vendored htmx + Chart.js
scripts/          up/down, vendor_assets, demo helpers
tests/            unit, detector fixtures, API, dashboard, end-to-end through the real sandbox
```

**Safety rules.** Test packages are inert and labelled SIMULATED; payloads only read fake files and only send to
`sink`; `shadowrun_net` is internal and `doctor` gates every run (fail closed); containers are non-root with
`cap_drop ALL` (plus `SYS_PTRACE` for analysis only), `no-new-privileges`, resource limits and a hard timeout, and are
always removed; no Docker socket in containers; all templates are autoescaped and the dashboard JS never builds HTML
from data; any error ends in BLOCK or ESCALATE, never ALLOW.
